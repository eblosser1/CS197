				<h4>Why We Hunt</h4>
					<p>Currently it is estimated that 20 veterans commit suicide a day. We belive
					that part of this reason is due to the difficulty to transitioning to a 
					civilian lifestyle. We hold our hunting events in order provide veterans an outlet	
					to meet others in similar situations while staying active.</p>

				<h4>How We Began</h4>
					<p>Phalanx Outdoors began after our founders transitioned out of the military. They 
					noticed that the lives they once knew would never return to normal. Hunting and other 
					outdoor activities provided them the ability to regain some normalcy. We wanted to share
					what we found with other veterans in hopes of giving them a next mission.</p>
